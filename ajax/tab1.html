Baja SAE is a single seated all-terrain vehicle design and fabrication competition for students organized by SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) India an affiliate to SAE International. Each teamâ€™s goal is to design and build a prototype of a rugged single seat, off-road recreational four-wheel vehicle. The Baja SAE series consists of seven competitions held across the globe. Students must function as a team not only to design, build, test, promote, and run a vehicle within the limits of the rules, but also to manage their educational priorities and at the same time generate financial support for their project.
