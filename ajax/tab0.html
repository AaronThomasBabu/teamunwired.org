			Hailing from God's own country,teamunwired is an ensemble of engineers-to-be
			at National Institute of Technology Calicut (NIT Calicut), one of the
			country's best technical institutes. We call ourselves Unwired, a team
			that relishes on engineering challenges. The primary motivation for
			competing in Baja SAE lies in the desire to go through the hands-on
			experience of building an engineering prototype and the thrill in
			watching it work. The 25-membered team comprises inter-disciplinary
			undergraduate students from 2nd to 4th year.
