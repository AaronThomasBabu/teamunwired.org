			Aerodynamically, the bumble bee shouldn't be able to fly, but the bumble bee doesn't know it so it goes on flying anyway.
			<br />With a zeal to fly higher in the sky, started with a HAB ( Hot Air Balloon) which gave way to small RC planes finally leading to our very own quadropter. During the past few years, Team-Unwired has participated in many aero-modeling competitions and organized workshops like chuck gliders to encourage the young minds.

		<p>A telescope and an open cloudless sky is the classroom for these group of people who come out at night in open space to explore the deep hidden secrets of the universe. The rings of Saturn look way beautiful when seen from one’s own telescope. To involve and encourage more students, frequent star gazing nights and astrophotography nights are organized.</p>
		<p>In the cold darkness of our hockey grounds, we sometimes unfold our tripods and peer into the night skies through our telescopes.We have two 90 mm Galilean telescopes.</p>

			Always looking to get our creations to challenge the cutting edge, books can be found piled up and dog-eared, complex equations broken and our own little theories cropping up as we build remote controlled aircrafts and amphibian transporters.
In IIST's technological fest( Conscientia), we got the second and third prize for the amphibian transporter  event(Salilsthalchar) and the robotics competition(Bots up). In NIT Trichy, we ended up first in the “NFS Aqua” remote controlled boat event.
There is nothing that enthralls us more than watching our little bots whirring through our workspace(Won the fourth prize in IIT Bombay's 2011 robo-polo) and our planes skimming the blue skies. We have built three remote controlled airplanes of our own, which have flown in various college technological fests like IITBombay's Techfest 2008 (18th position out of 120+ teams)
