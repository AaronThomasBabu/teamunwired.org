	<span style="color:#F31414; font-size:22px">Why sponsor teamunwired</span><br />
	<p>NIT Calicut is the only team from Kerala that has qualified for the finals of the competition after competing with more than 250 national teams.</p>
	<p>Being the top ranked institute in Kerala, extensive media coverage is assured for the event, both before and during the event. It is also worth mentioning that BAJA SAE is an event that is widely anticipated throughout the world and media coverage occurs in the international level. </p>
	<br/>Also, Our previous attempt bagged a lot of laurels:
		<ol>
	<li>First team in the history of Baja SAE India to completely design and fabricate a gearbox.</li>
	<li>7th Best designed vehicle in Baja SAE India 2010</li>
	<li>Third lightest vehicle in the history of Baja SAE India</li>
	<li>First team to ever use chromoly in Baja SAE India</li>
	<li>Amongst the first teams to use a CVT in Baja SAE India</li>
		</ol>
	Without your support, we would only have fertile ideas with no hope of concrete fabrication.
