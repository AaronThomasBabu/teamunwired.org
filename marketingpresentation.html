		<li>The 2012 Baja SAE in the Indian zone will be held in Pithampur, Indore in the month of February.</li>
		<li>Each team's goal will be to design and build a prototype of a rugged, single seat, off-road recreational vehicle intended for sale to the non-professional, weekend off-road enthusiast.</li>
		<li>The India chapter will also sponsor at least the best team to participate abroad.</li>
