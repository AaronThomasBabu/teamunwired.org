<p>Baja SAE is a single seated all-terrain vehicle design and fabrication competition for students organized by SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) India an affiliate to SAE International. Each team's goal is to design and build a prototype of a rugged single seat, off-road recreational four-wheel vehicle. The Baja SAE series consists of seven competitions held across the globe. Students must function as a team not only to design, build, test, promote, and run a vehicle within the limits of the rules, but also to manage their educational priorities and at the same time generate financial support for their project.</p>
<p>We participated in Baja SAE 2010 and 2012, both held in Pithampur near Indore in the NATRAX facility. Gasotech was our title sponsor in both attempts and we extend our heartfelt gratitude to Mr Prakash Shetty, our alumni and Managing Director of Gasotech India Ltd.  </p>
