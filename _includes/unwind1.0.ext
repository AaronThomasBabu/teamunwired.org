<h3>Gasotech Unwind 1.0</h3>
<p>Our decision to take part in Baja SAE 2010 required radical changes in the
approach of the student community towards projects. The college provided us with
a workspace and work began in the summer of 2009. Everything was new to the team
members and so everything was built from scratch. The Gasotech Unwind 1.0 was
special because a gearbox was built by the students, a CVT was incorporated in
the transmission and the chassis was made of chromoly. This made the car stand
out from the others and was one of the lightest cars in the event. It was also
the 8th best in terms of design.</p>
