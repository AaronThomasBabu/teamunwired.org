<h3>Gasotech Unwind 2.0</h3>
<p>Our second foray into the Baja SAE event was in 2012. The team was able to get the car up and running three months in advance to the competition, allowing ample time to run tests and tune the vehicle. It comes as no surprise then that we were able to do so well. We were called the "Leopards of Kerala" by the other teams considering our hill climbing ability and quick acceleration.</p>
