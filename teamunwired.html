	<h2>Teamunwired</h2>
	<h3>Who we are:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A group of motivated students from NIT Calicut brought together by their common love for technology.</li>
		<li>From 2nd to 4th year students across various disciplines.</li>
		<li>We are 22 in number, with division of labour for efficient functioning.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>What we do:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>We conduct scientific exploration purely to understand in depth the beauty of how the world works.</li>
		<li>We undertake engineering projects that challenge us, make us think and broaden our spectrum of activities.</li>
		<li>With the knowledge we gain, we participate in events all over the country.</li>
		
	</ul>

	<h3 >Why we do this:</h3>
	<ul>

	<div class="main1">
			<img src="graphics/aero.png" class="goldenImage" />
	</div>
	<div class="main2">
		
		<p>With a zeal to fly higher, we started with a HAB ( Hot Air Balloon) workshop which gave way to small RC planes finally leading to our very own quadropter. </p>
		<p>In the past few years, Team-Unwired has participated in many aero-modeling competitions and organized workshops like chuck gliders to nurture young minds.</p>
		<p>We have built three remote controlled airplanes of our own, which have flown in various college technological fests like IITBombay's Techfest 2008 (18th position out of 120+ teams)</p>

	</div>
	<div class="main2">
		<p>A telescope and an open cloudless sky is all we need to explore the hidden secrets of the universe.</p>
		<p>Seeing it through your own telescope after meticulous adjustments and calibrations however is what is truly out of the world.</p>
                <p>We have two 90 mm Galilean telescopes and to involve our peer, star gazing and astrophotography nights are organised regularly.</p>

	<p>We didnt let go of the love every child has for automobile. We thrive on it.</p>
<p>We have held exhibitions on cars ( called Wheels in <b>Tathva</b>) and hope we got younger minds to keep their passion for cars alive</p>
<p>This is not mentioning the fact that we have already built both remote controlled and life size off road vahicles</p>
<p> Baja SAE is our latest and most challenging project.</p>

<p>Our seniors took time out from their busy schedules to give us coaching on Solidworks DS. It is only with this tool that we were able to <b>clear Virtual BAJA.</b></p>
<p>In <b>Aakruti</b>, a CAD competition held by <b>dassault systems</b>, we were the first runner up, having presented the gearbox we designed and created for our previous BAJA project.</p>
<p> We have used CNC machines to fabricate a VAWT after design through <b>Solidworks</b>.</p>

<p>Paathshaala is a place to learn and share information.It is a <b>content sharing repository inside NIT Calicut</b>.</br> This project won numerous awards including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A national database design competition by Linux for You magazine.</li>
	<li>Software presentation contest, login 2011, pgstech</li>
	
</ul>
	Visit Paathshaala inside NITC Campus at <a href='http://192.168.5.27/' target='_blank' >http://192.168.5.27/</a>.
