				<p>Hailing from God’s own country, Team Unwired is an ensemble
					of undergraduates pursuing engineering as their major at the
					National Institute of Technology Calicut (NITC), the
					country’s best technical institute. Team Unwired strives
					towards achieving its primary goal to gain hands on
					experience of building an engineering prototype from the
					knowledge and concepts gained over the course of the
					academic years.</p>
				<p>Team Unwired is the forefront of technical projects in NITC,
					being involved in a wide array of activities and events
					nationwide, competing to the very top at every
					opportunity. Events ranging in areas of aero modelling,
					radio control modelling, rocket modelling, website
					designing, and its most important field automobiles. Team
					Unwired also holds regular CAD and auto seminars for free of
					admission available to anyone willing to join the sessions
					for the simple cause of spreading knowledge and encouraging
					students to take up innovative projects. Ensuring hands on
					learning which supplements classroom learning, strengthens
					fundamentals and cultivates skills that will help students
					further their career objectives.</p>
				<p>Started only three short years ago by three motivated
					students, the achievements is a long list that the ever
					growing team since then is to be proud of.</p>
